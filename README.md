# Plant Disease Prediction - CNN Image Classifier

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases based on leaf images. It employs the **PlantVillage dataset** to train a model that can recognize various plant diseases across different plant types.

## Features
- CNN-based image classification with multiple convolutional layers.
- Data augmentation and pre-processing using `ImageDataGenerator`.
- Training, validation, and evaluation on a large dataset of plant images.
- Achieves a validation accuracy of approximately 88%.
